                keywords: ['transit', 'method', 'detect', 'detection'],
                response: "The transit method detects exoplanets by measuring the tiny dip in a star's brightness when a planet passes in front of it. It's like a mini-eclipse! The size of the dip tells us the planet's size, and how often it happens reveals the orbital period."

The shape, depth, and duration of these dips reveal details about the planet's size, orbit, and even its atmosphere!"

It was one of the first missions dedicated to finding exoplanets using the transit method, discovering 34 confirmed planets including some of the first rocky exoplanets ever found."

It's already detected water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other molecules on distant worlds, helping us understand if they could support life!"
